# Home_Depot_Scrapper

### Project

I have a client who reached out to ask if I am able to scrape a website to extract certain information to better examine new trends and prices. We discussed on what he needs for this project, and we agreed on the following list listed below. How will this be useful? This will help to study trends, anaylize pricing, study reviews, and for better planning to source new materail. 

1. Search a cerain text before the report runs (For this example I searched for 'Floor Tiles')
    
2. Who is Selling the product.
    
3. The Description of the product.

4. How much are they selling it for. 
    
5. Percent Rating(s) based on Customer.
    
6. Promo detail information.
